# **DESCRIPTION**:
The Generative Text Tool is a Python script designed to create new, coherent text based on patterns learned from a training corpus. It utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which is a type of recurrent neural network particularly effective for sequential data like text.

Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

* **Learning from Text:** The model is trained on a given text dataset (even a small one for demonstration) to understand the sequence of characters and their statistical relationships.
* **Character-Level Generation:** It operates at a character level, predicting the next character in a sequence based on the preceding characters.
* **Seed Prompt:** Text generation starts from a "seed" or prompt provided by the user.
* **Temperature Control:** A "temperature" parameter allows for controlling the randomness and creativity of the generated text. Lower temperatures lead to more predictable and conservative output, while higher temperatures result in more diverse and experimental text.

In essence, this tool demonstrates the fundamental principles of how neural networks can learn to generate human-like text by predicting subsequent characters in a sequence.
